  <h3>Coding Portfolio</h3>
  <p3> Upon graduating with a BSBA in Finance with Concentration in Accounting (Cum Laude) from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, I went to went to work at a global manufacturer / service provider. I started my career at that company as a Staff Accountant, and was quickly promoted to Business Analyst, and finally to Pricing Manager – I was also the department’s Salesforce administrator, among many other hats. 
My love and excitement for computers started when I was an intern and tasked with recreating thousands of forms which were handwritten into an editable electronic format. Through this challenge and experience I quickly delved into Microsoft VBA Coding and became SO excited about the possibilities that programming can offer. Fast-forward to now, I am working full-time as a Business Analyst and also enrolled in the Women’s Cohort of MIT’s Coding Bootcamp (October 2021 – August 2022). I am living with my fiancée and also working remotely in Houston, Texas. If you’d like to know more please email me at katrinafrizzell@gmail.com.
